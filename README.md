# Understanding NoSQL

The concept of NoSQL (also known as Not Only SQL) is an alternative to SQL (Structured Query Language). However, despite the name, NoSQL doesn't completely throw out the concept of structure in how its presented - implied by its alias. The concept is more to have a freeform, dynamic design while addressing some of the more troublesome parts of regular SQL. 

## Comparing SQL and NoSQL
In general, we can summarise the comparisons between SQL and NoSQL into a table.


|Feature     |SQL                   |NoSQL                     |
| ------     | ------               | ------                   |
|Type        |Structured            |Dynamic                   |
|Languages   |MySQL, SQLServer, etc.|Python, C#, MongoDB, etc. |
|Design      |"Table Design"        |Freeform                  |
|Scalability |Vertical              |Horizontal                |

By dynamic, we mean a form of structure that is a lot more flexible. Instead of being very stiff in how information is stored, NoSQL can be quite relaxed so long as the rules it sets are still followed. Design (or schema design) is the form it takes in visualising the concept. SQL is has a "table design" because upon looking at information within SQL it presents itself as just that, tables. NoSQL on the other hand has a lot more forms it can take, which we will look into, along with the differences in scalability and what this means.

## NoSQL Schema Design



To give an example, in SQL scalability is vertical, meaning a more packed load of querying and storage will need a better machine to handle the database ()
